      <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
      <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there </p>
      <h4 id="day 1">Day 1</h4>
      <p>On our firt day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picutre!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em></p>

      <h4 id="day 2">Day 2</h4>
      <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br /><br />After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.

      <h4 id="day 3">Day 3</h4>
      <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.
